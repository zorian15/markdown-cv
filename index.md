## Research Experience

`June 2020-Present`
__Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center__

- Predoctoral candidate
- Developing computational tools to predict viral protein phenotypes from deep mutational scanning experiments with the goal to accurately predict fitness of unseen protein variants and predict viral evolutionary trajectories.

__University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences__

- Lab rotation with [Brian Beliveau](https://www.beliveau.io)
- Implemented a bioinformatics pipeline for the design of split-oligo probe pairs for fluorescence *in situ* hybridization (FISH) experiments to enable fast and affordable design of highly specific RNA FISH probes.

`Jan. 2020-March 2020`
__Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center__

- Lab rotation with [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fhcrc.org)
- See related entry above.

`Sep. 2019-Dec 2019`
__University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences__

- Lab rotation with [Bill Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu)
- Implemented a novel method for systematically finding potential functional inter-chromosomal contacts in Hi-C data to provide better understanding of genome organization.

`Aug. 2018-May 2019`
__Virginia Tech Department of Statistics__

- Undergraduate research with [Allison N. Tegge](https://www.stat.vt.edu/people/stat-faculty/tegge-allison.html)
- Implemented Self-Organizing Maps and conducted survival analysis to identify genes and pathways associated with progression of colorectal cancer from patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas Program.

`Aug. 2017-May 2019`
__Virginia Tech Department of Statistics__

- Undergraduate research with [Leah R. Johnson](http://leah.johnson-gramacy.com/QED/research/)

`June 2017-Aug 2017`
__University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences__

- Lab rotation with [Jim Bruce](https://brucelab.gs.washington.edu)
- Implemented [software](http://xlinkdb.gs.washington.edu/xlinkdb/) to estimate and visualize inter-surface regions of cross-linked proteins, enabling scientists to better characterize protein function, discover mutations, and discover protein-protein interactions to tackle molecular challenges such as cancer.
